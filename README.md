# Gone Phish'n - Phising and Spam Detector Application

The purpose of this project was to create and train a naive Bayes classifer to determine if an email is spam or not.
Gone Phish'n is a desktop application that uses custom trained multinomial naive Bayes classifiers to detect malicious phishing URLS and spam emails in real time.

### Project Goal
Design, train, and implement two independent naive Bayes models:
- One trained on URL structure and domain patterns to detect phishing links
- One trained on email bodies to identify spam and scam content
